# Cropsensor
CropSense is a simple and user-friendly web app that helps farmers and gardening enthusiasts quickly understand the health of their crops. By selecting a crop—like Rice, Wheat, or Cotton—and an observed symptom, such as Yellow Leaves, Brown Spots, or Wilting, users instantly get an easy-to-understand analysis: the possible issue affecting the crop, a health score, and practical advice like using fertilizers, fungicides, or checking soil conditions. The app is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and features a clean, responsive design with a calming background and overlay, making it visually appealing and easy to use. Right now, CropSense covers basic crop-symptom combinations and ensures users make both selections before showing results. Looking ahead, the app aims to grow smarter and more helpful by adding more crops and symptoms, integrating AI for accurate disease detection, showing real-time weather and soil insights, displaying visual health indicators, and supporting multiple languages and mobile devices, making it a handy tool for farmers everywhere.
